* Jun 24 2018 4.0.0

- Add "recursive" mode to 'getcpids' (use as `getcpids -r $PID'), which will get all children of given pid, their children, and so on for all levels of children

- Some cleanups / code improvements

- Allow 'waitpid' application to accept multiple pids and wait for all to complete

- Allow 'getcpids' application to accept multiple pids and print the children of all arguments

- Implement a simple integer hash-map.

- Replace the "compound pids" large struct-based storage to the hash-map impl in getcpids.c. 
  Since multiple pids are supported, this prevents duplicates in a recursive ( -r ) operation wherein both a parent and a child-at-some-level are given as arguments

* Nov 22 2017 3.1.1

- Fixup Makefile to pass along PREFIX correctly for "make install", and update
install-into-home logic


* Nov 22 2017 3.1.0

- Fix all memory leaks

- Better handle memory in several circumstances

- Reduce memory footprint slightly

- Add some more comments and improve names of a few variables/functions

- Report an error for getppid when a non-existant pid is provided or another error occurs (like process closes during execution before we obtain the ppid) instead of printing "0" as the pid

- If cannot read the 'stat' file (certain configurations may block this for processes owned by another user), add missing return 0 (error return)

- Rewrite getcpids.c to ensure proper alignment, and optimize/simplify some things

- Fix rare condition in getcpids where under certain circumstances an extra bogus pid could be printed (not sure if this was possible before, the rewrite may have exposed it)


* Sep 1 2017 3.0.0

- Add `getpenv` application, which reads an environment variable from
arbitrary process


* May 11 2017 2.0.1
- Update Makefile to ease development and custom flags
- Add some additional Makefile targets, which are listed in comments at top of
Makefile
- Add INSTALL file which describes how to compile and install/package
- Work around a WRONG gcc warning (and remove need for -Wno-unused-function)

* May 11 2017 2.0.0
- Add "waitpid" command, which waits for a given pid to terminate/complete
- Fix where compilation wouldn't work by default on old compilers which
defaulted to C89. Now, we detect if gnu99 is a viable target, if so, use that,
otherwise use C99.
- Fix issue (work around make bug?) where sometimes running "make" would
recompile things that didn't need to be recompiled
- Default with some flags which will trim and optimize a bit during link-time
- Add a make target, "make static', which will generate completely static
executables


* Apr 30 2017 1.0.0
- Add getpcmd to get the commandline string (optionally quoted) of a given pid
- Add isparentof to determine if a pid is the parent of another pid, at any
level (direct parent, parent-of-parent, etc)
- Add ischildof to determine if a pid is the child of another pid, at any
level (direct child, child-of-child, etc)
- Add --help and --version to all commands
- Some cleanups, optimizations
- Error check that integer arguments are integers



* Nov 4 2016 0.1.0
- Initial Release
