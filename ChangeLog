* May 11 2017 2.0.1
- Update Makefile to ease development and custom flags
- Add some additional Makefile targets, which are listed in comments at top of
Makefile
- Add INSTALL file which describes how to compile and install/package
- Work around a WRONG gcc warning (and remove need for -Wno-unused-function)

* May 11 2017 2.0.0
- Add "waitpid" command, which waits for a given pid to terminate/complete
- Fix where compilation wouldn't work by default on old compilers which
defaulted to C89. Now, we detect if gnu99 is a viable target, if so, use that,
otherwise use C99.
- Fix issue (work around make bug?) where sometimes running "make" would
recompile things that didn't need to be recompiled
- Default with some flags which will trim and optimize a bit during link-time
- Add a make target, "make static', which will generate completely static
executables

- Add getpcmd to get the commandline string (optionally quoted) of a given pid
- Add isparentof to determine if a pid is the parent of another pid, at any
level (direct parent, parent-of-parent, etc)
- Add ischildof to determine if a pid is the child of another pid, at any
level (direct child, child-of-child, etc)
- Add --help and --version to all commands
- Some cleanups, optimizations
- Error check that integer arguments are integers
